Hello!

We are Jay & Cris, your Discovery Pool operators. Invested since 2017, we took part in the ITN, running a stake pool on jormungandr for over 3 months (ticker: ADAT).

We believe in Cardano's mission and we want to support the network by running a stake pool. Rewards will go towards maintaing and securing the nodes in their different locations across the world, as well as helping us with a much bigger project: driving around Africa to meet local producers and help them access the wider market by setting them up on the Cardano network. More information about our project here: https://bumpydetour.com/

### Stake Pool

 Ticker: DIVY | Location: Amsterdam
 
### Relay List

We decided the locate our three relay nodes across the world to ensure fast block propagation across the network.
 
- blue.adatrain.com:6003 (ASIA)
- red.adatrain.com:6003 (EUROPE)
- purple.adatrain.com:6003 (USA)

### Future

We plan to add and run an additional 2 relays as well as upgrade our current setup (more RAM/DISK).

### Fee Structure

The fixed fee is set to 340, the minimum.

Currently, to increase the number of delegators and delegated stake, and to showcase the performance of our setup, we have set the variable fee at 0%. This will change in the futur epochs to ensure our pool's operations can be sustained in the long run. Our fee structure will become a variable 2% fee on rewards.

### Why delegate to us?

 1. **Fees to maintain the network**: With our fee set at 2% (currently 0% to attract delegators), we will be able to secure and maintain all our nodes and associated relays.
 2. **Dedicated server**: we run our pools on reliable, virtual private servers located in Amsterdam, Singapore and New York.
 3. **24/7 Monitored**: We continuously check our pool's performance via monitoring tools and alerts.
 4. **Up to date**: We make sure to always run the latest versions of the program, and keep our stake pools well maintained.
 5. **2M Self pledge**: We self pledged 2M Ada to our pools which gives us the incentive to achieve the best performance possible, as well as secure our setup.

### Latest News
- epoch 212: All systems are running properly and updated to the latest version. First block created on August 19th! 6 blocks created in total so far. For this epoch, you will not only get our thank you for your support, but real ada rewards too :-)
- epoch 211: All systems are running properly and up to date. We were hoping to create our first block during epoch 211 but the lottery was not with us unfortunately.
- epoch 210: All systems are running properly and up to date. Active staked Ada increased from 6.4 to 11.2M - thank you for delegating to our pool.

### About

Cardano is a public blockchain and cryptocurrency project. It requires decentralized node servers to validate and secure the blockchain for all participants. If you hold Ada (â‚³) cryptocurrency, you can participate in this process and earn rewards by staking your Ada. 

Your Ada remains within your complete control at all times and you are still allowed to transfer, spend, or move your staking delegation to another stake pool. Jump onboard the Ada Train for staking your Ada and earning rewards.
