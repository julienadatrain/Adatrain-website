### Fee Structure
Our fee structure is very simple, a variable **3%  fee** on rewards.

No fix fee. No maximum cap on tax rewards.

### Why delegate to us?

 1. **Low fees**: With our fee set at 3%, you will maximise your staking rewards.
 2. **Dedicated server**: we run our pools on reliable, redundant virtual private servers located in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London. 24/7 Guarantee
 3. **24/7 Monitored**: We continuously check our pool's performance via monitoring tools and alerts.
 4. **Up to date**: We make sure to always run the latest versions of the program, and keep our stake pools well maintained.
 5. **Self pledge**: We will self pledge to our pools which gives us the incentive to achieve the best performance possible.

### About

Cardano is a public blockchain and cryptocurrency project. It requires decentralized node servers to validate and secure the blockchain for all participants. If you hold Ada (â‚³) cryptocurrency, you can participate in this process and earn rewards by staking your Ada. 

Your Ada remains within your complete control at all times and you are still allowed to transfer, spend, or move your staking delegation to another stake pool. Jump onboard the Ada Train for staking your Ada and earning rewards.
