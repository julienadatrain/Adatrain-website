We are Jay & Cris, your Discovery Pool operators. We're in the world of Cardano since 2017, we took part in the ITN, successfully operating Jormungandr for over 3 months.

We believe in Cardano's mission. The fees we receive will go towards maintaining and securing the nodes in their different locations across the world.

The fees will also help us with a much bigger project: driving around Africa, Asia and the Middle East to meet local producers and creators, and help them access the wider market by setting them up on Cardano. We've got a lot of projects in mind, from building an app to detect road potholes, fix them and reward the worker to supporting reforestation projects by using satellite zone scanning.


### Why delegate to us?

 1. **Fees** Simple, it's 2% for DIVY1,DIVY2 and DIVY3. It's 0% for DIVY4!
 2. **Servers**: Reliable dedicated servers located across the world.
 3. **24/7 Monitored**: Alerts and monitoring is in place.
 4. **Up to date**: Alays updated to the latest released version.
 5. **2M Ada Self pledge**: Our incentive to achieve the best performance possible.
 6. **Logs**: We update this page regularly with status updates and epoch debrief.

### Current Epoch

All DIVY pools are operational and producing blocks. Upgrading to 1.26.2

### How to check for performance ?
Our pools are minting blocks, yes. But how performant exactly is our setup ? DIVY pools report the number of blocks assigned at the start of each epoch on pooltool.io. Navigate to [DIVY1](https://pooltool.io/pool/654d96593e499e70889eeae16a15ad8682f8349fd1b77726bbbf8a6d/epochs), [DIVY2](https://pooltool.io/pool/b42eae6ad659bd5e2187975a36816b712422bfd5b64ea32f52781096/delegators), [DIVY3](https://pooltool.io/pool/74e1795dc06165e4a1b55d8930c00379b029c2a145ff225255154129/epochs) or [DIVY4](https://pooltool.io/pool/614bb865b1902f54b540209b37ad404eef1db1589a5d9eafe7a6db71/epochs) and under the metic Assigned Performance, you will find how many blocks were produced versus how many blocks were assigned.


### Archive per Epoch

| Epoch  | Update  |
|---|---|
|  259 | No issues to report, 100% uptime! |
|  258 | All BP nodes and relays successfully upgraded to 1.26.1 with no downtime. Great epoch all-round! |
|  257 | All nodes were online and produced all blocks. |
|  256 | No issues to report, all nodes were online. Unfortunately, no blocks were assigned to DIVY4 this epoch. |
|  255 | No issues to report, 100% uptime! |
|  254 | No issues and 100% uptime. |
|  253 | Great epoch for DIVY pools, no issues to flag, 7.5% ROA for epoch 253 on DIVY3! |
|  252 | 10% ROA on DIVY3! Good performance on all other pools too, 100% uptime. |
|  251 | HFC Mary update happened without issue. DIVY pools had some good luck this epoch, all blocks minted! |
|  250 | No problem to report. All nodes and relays worked hard to create blocks on the Cardano network. |
|  249 | Unfortunately, DIVY3 was not lucky this epoch, with no blocks assigned to the pool. Epoch 250 was much better for DIVY3 with 170% luck! All other pools have produced all blocks assigned with 100% uptime. |
|  248 | All pools working to plan |
|  247 | 100 working! |
|  246 | Everything went to plan and  was closely monitored, as usual. |
|  245 | No problem to report. Every system go! |
|  244 | Another great epoch across all DIVY pools. Upgraded to 1.25.1 , all pools and relays are ready for Mary HFC. |
|  243 | Perfect epoch with all blocks minted. |
|  242 | Great epoch, great performance from all DIVY pools. |
|  241 | One more relay added (UK). 2 blocks missed (DIVY2) due to block battles lost vs other pools. All other blocks minted! |
|  240 | All indicators positive. Happy stacking! |
|  239 | Perfect epoch. |
|  238 | Another perfect epoch! All leader blocks were successfully minted. |
|  237 | No issues to report. All leader blocks were successfully minted. |
|  236 | No issues and great performance from DIVY1, DIVY2 and DIVY3! |
|  235 | Updated all relays to 1.24.2 with no issues, we minted all the blocks given except 1 stolen. |
|  234 | All systems were operational. |
|  233 | All systems were operational. DIVY1 had some bad luck with the lottery, getting only 85% of the blocks expected, but minting 100% of the blocks given. DIVY2 was more lucky and minted all blocks given too. |
|  232 | All systems were operational and we launched DIVY4 pool. |
|  231 | Upgrade to all nodes successful and we launched DIVY3 pool. |
|  231 | All systems were operational |
|  230 | All systems were operational |
|  229 | All systems were operational |
|  228 | All systems were operational |
|  227 | All systems were operational - 100% uptime. Rewards will be issued as normal |
|  226 | Despite a successful epoch with 90 blocks created, no rewards have been distributed to the pool or its delegators due to a mistake I made related to the pool's pledge amount. During epoch 226, I created a second pool (DIVY2) and split the pledge equally between the two pools. I thought DIVY's pool certificate, once updated, just needed to match the pledge of the certificate at the immediate time - which it did. I've learned since that it needed to match the certificate's pledge at the start of the epoch - which in retrospect makes sense. I should have waited for one epoch before transferring the pledge difference. The epoch, therefore, ended with a pledge not met, as the pledge amount was under the pledge set at the start of the epoch. This resulted in no rewards distributed. I am truly sorry for this mistake, it was not my intention to abuse your trust by not distributing your rewards. I understand that this mistake impacted all DIVY's delegators and whilst it was a relatively easy mistake to make, it's one that had the most extreme of consequences. The rewards can't be claimed back and have now joined the treasury. While I can't provide you with a full compensation for the loss incurred, I will drop the fees by half, to 1%, until the end of the year as an apology. Please note that I did not earn any rewards for this epoch, from the pledge or pool fees.|

|  218 | All systems were operational - 100% uptime. No technical issues or missed blocks, just bad luck with the lottery. |
|  217 | All systems were operational - 100% uptime.|
|  216 | All systems were operational - 100% uptime.|

|  210 | All systems were operational - 100% uptime. Active staked Ada increased from 6.4 to 11.2M - thank you for delegating to our pool. |
