# Our Live Cardano Stake Pools:

Hi! We believe in Cardano's mission and we want to support the network by running stake pools (validating nodes).

# Live Train Pools

 - Ticker: ADAT | Location: Amsterdam

# Fee Structure
Our fee structure is very simple, a variable **3%  fee** on rewards.

We don't chage a fix fee. We don't set up a cap on the tax.

# Why delegate to us?

 1. **LOW FEES**: With our fee set at 3%, you will maximise your staking rewards.
 2. **FAST DEDICATED SERVER**: we run our pools on reliable, redundant virtual private servers located in Amsterdam, Frankfurt and London. 24/7 Guarantee
 3. **MONITORED**: We continuously check our pool's performance via monitoring tools and alerts.
 4. **UP TO DATE**: We make sure to always run the latest versions of the program, and keep our stake pools well maintained.
 5. **SELF-PLEDGE**: We will self pledge to our pools which gives us the incentive to achieve the best performance possible.

## News

- 7 February 2020: Upgraded the server to achieve better performance.
