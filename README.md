### DISCOVERY Stake Pool:

Hello!

We are Jay & Cris, your pool operators. We believe in Cardano's mission and we want to support the network by running a stake pool (a validating node). Rewards will go towards maintaing and securing the nodes in their different locations across the world.

### Stake Pool

 Ticker: DIVY | Location: Amsterdam
 
 ### Relay List
 
- blue.adatrain.com:6003 (ASIA)
- red.adatrain.com:6003 (EUROPE)
- purple.adatrain.com:6003 (USA)

### Fee Structure

The fixed fee is set to 340, the minimum.

Currently, to increase the number of delegators and delegated stake, and to showcase the performance of our setup, we have set the variable fee at 1%. This will change in between epochs 212 and 215, our fee structure will become a variable 2% fee on rewards.

### Why delegate to us?

 1. **Fees to maintain the network**: With our fee set at 2% (currently 1% to attract delegators), we hope to be able to secure and maintain all our nodes and associated relays.
 2. **Dedicated server**: we run our pools on reliable, virtual private servers located in Amsterdam, Singapore and New York.
 3. **24/7 Monitored**: We continuously check our pool's performance via monitoring tools and alerts.
 4. **Up to date**: We make sure to always run the latest versions of the program, and keep our stake pools well maintained.
 5. **2M Self pledge**: We self pledged 2M Ada to our pools which gives us the incentive to achieve the best performance possible, as well as secure our setup.

### Latest News
- epoch 209: All systems running properly and up to date. Discovery Stake Pool is now appearing in Daedalus.
- epoch 208: Discovery Stake Pool + 3 Relay Nodes are live and running. We have sadly been affected by the Daedalus bug and our pool did not appear in the list.

### About

Cardano is a public blockchain and cryptocurrency project. It requires decentralized node servers to validate and secure the blockchain for all participants. If you hold Ada (â‚³) cryptocurrency, you can participate in this process and earn rewards by staking your Ada. 

Your Ada remains within your complete control at all times and you are still allowed to transfer, spend, or move your staking delegation to another stake pool. Jump onboard the Ada Train for staking your Ada and earning rewards.
