We are Jay & Cris, your Discovery Pool operators. Invested since 2017, we took part in the ITN, running a stake pool on jormungandr for over 3 months (ticker: ADAT).

We believe in Cardano's mission and we want to support the network by running a stake pool. Rewards will go towards maintaing and securing the nodes in their different locations across the world, as well as helping us with a much bigger project: driving around Africa to meet local producers and help them access the wider market by setting them up on the Cardano network.

### Stake Pool Ticker

Ticker: DIVY
Fees: 340 + 0%

### Why delegate to us?

 1. **0% Fees**: Currently set at 0%, our aim is always to provide you with the best returns. Enjoy one of the highest ROI on the network!
 2. **Dedicated server**: We run our pools on reliable servers located in Amsterdam, Singapore and New York.
 3. **24/7 Monitored**: We continuously check our pool's performance via monitoring and alerts.
 4. **Up to date**: We will always run DIVY on the latest version, and keep our stake pool well maintained and secured.
 5. **2M Self pledge**: We self pledged 2M Ada to our pools which gives us the incentive to achieve the best performance possible, as well as secure our setup.
 6. **Logs**: We will update this page regularly with status updates and epoch debrief.

### Current Epoch

Epoch 213: Epoch transition happened with no issues. All systems go.

### Archive per Epoch

| Epoch  | Update  |
|---|---|
|  212 | All systems operational. Pool + Relays updated to latest version. First ever block created on August 19th, 6 blocks created in total. |
|  211 | All systems operational. We were hoping to create our first block during epoch 211 but the lottery was not with us. |
|  210 | All systems operational. Active staked Ada increased from 6.4 to 11.2M - thank you for delegating to our pool. |
|  209 | All systems operational. Discovery Stake Pool is now appearing in Daedalus. |
|  208 | Pool and relays are now live. Our pool was affected by the Daedalus bug and our pool did not appear in the pool list. |
 
### Relay List

We decided the locate our three relay nodes across the world to ensure fast block propagation across the network.
 
- blue.adatrain.com:6003 (ASIA)
- red.adatrain.com:6003 (EUROPE)
- purple.adatrain.com:6003 (USA)

### Future

We plan to add and run an additional 2 relays as well as upgrade our current setup (more RAM/DISK).

### About

Cardano is a public blockchain and cryptocurrency project. It requires decentralized node servers to validate and secure the blockchain for all participants. If you hold Ada (â‚³) cryptocurrency, you can participate in this process and earn rewards by staking your Ada. 

Your Ada remains within your complete control at all times and you are still allowed to transfer, spend, or move your staking delegation to another stake pool. Jump onboard the Ada Train for staking your Ada and earning rewards.
