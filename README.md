We are Jay & Cris, your Discovery Pool operators. We are in the world of Cardano since 2017, we took part in the recent ITN, running a stake pool on jormungandr for over 3 months (ticker: ADAT).

We believe in Cardano's mission and we want to support the network by running a stake pool. Rewards will go towards maintaing and securing the nodes in their different locations across the world, as well as helping us with a much bigger project: driving around Africa, Asia and the Middle East to meet local producers and creators, and help them access the wider market by setting them up on Cardano.


### Stake Pool Ticker

Ticker: DIVY

Fees: 340 + 0%

Please note, we will set a fee at 2% on the 1st of November which will become effective after 2 epochs.

### Why delegate to us?

 1. **0% Fees - Moving to 2% on the 1st of November**: Currently set at 0%, our aim will always be to provide you with the best returns. Enjoy one of the highest ROI on the network!
 2. **Dedicated server**: We run our pools on secure, reliable servers located in Amsterdam, Singapore and New York.
 3. **24/7 Monitored**: We continuously check our pool's performance via monitoring and alerts. It's always warm and sunny at DIVY pool.
 4. **Up to date**: We keep our stake pool updated to the latest tested version.
 5. **2M Self pledge**: We self pledged 2M Ada to our pools which gives us the incentive to achieve the best performance possible.
 6. **Logs**: We update this page regularly with status updates and epoch debrief.

### Relays

Three relay nodes across the world to ensure fast block propagation across the network.

### Future

We plan to add and run an additional 2 relays as well as upgrade our current setup (more RAM/DISK).

### About

Cardano is a public blockchain and cryptocurrency project. It requires decentralized node servers to validate and secure the blockchain for all participants. If you hold Ada (â‚³) cryptocurrency, you can participate in this process and earn rewards by staking your Ada. 

Your Ada remains within your complete control at all times and you are still allowed to transfer, spend, or move your staking delegation to another stake pool. Jump onboard the Ada Train for staking your Ada and earning rewards.
